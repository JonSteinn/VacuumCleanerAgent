## Server
A server is provided with this project along with 10 maps. I have converted all of those into JUnit tests so it should suffice to run the test. I do not own these maps!

## Sedgewick and Wayne's algorithms
I borrowed a Graph datastructure, heap and a MST algorithm from Sedgewick and Wayne. All of which are in a package called algorithms, which I do not own!

## Overview of approach
